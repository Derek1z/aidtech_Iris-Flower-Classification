Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to classify the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal length and width. It includes a Python script that loads the Iris dataset, pre-processes the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets, trains a K-Nearest Neighbors model, evaluates the model's performance on the testing set, and allows the user to input new data for prediction.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager. 

python iris_classification.py

This will load the Iris dataset, split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a K-Nearest Neighbors model, evaluate the model's performance on the testing set, and allow the user to input new data for prediction.

When prompted, enter values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to see the predicted species of iris flower.
